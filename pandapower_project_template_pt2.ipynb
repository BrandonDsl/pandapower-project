Documentations about this library can be found here: <a href=\"https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/v2.4.0/\">pandapower documentations</a><url>.

When finished, the assignment must be submitted as a <b>zip file</b> on eCampus in the Assignments section before <b>Friday, December 8, 23:59</b>. The zip file must contain a report in pdf format describing your results and analyses as well as the python notebook you completed for the assignment.
